 Hi, I'm Ana Maria.<br />
              For over a decade I've been creating visual. In early 2021 I
              became heavily interested in studying and developing websites,
              with a particular emphasis on blending my artistic backgroundÂ with
              responsive web designs. In May, I attended The Coders Guild's
              JAMStack Bootcamp to gain further skills and knowledge.
