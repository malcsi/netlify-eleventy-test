  Ana-Maria Horhoianu has been a visual artist since she was in elementary school. She discovered coding in March 2021 and became quite enthusiastic about pursuing it as a career.
 
  She enrolled at The Coders Guild's JAMStack Bootcamp in late May. She is now comfortable dealing with HTML, CSS (her preferred language), JavaScript, Bootstrap frameworks, Git and Github, APIs, and SSG.

  Ana-Maria is heavily involved in studying and building websites, with a particular emphasis on fusing her visual arts background with online design.
